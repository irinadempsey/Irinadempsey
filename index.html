            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/photo2.jpg" alt="Irina Dempsey" class="profile-image">
            <p>These days, I serve as a Scrum Master for a project within the Automotive Industry, leading and guiding a team of engineers towards achieving key goals.</p>
        </section>

            <p> When I was little, I was completely obsessed with Lego and Meccano – they weren’t just toys, they were the gateway to my curiosity about how things are made. This led me down the path of Mechanical Engineering, but after a few years, I realized that my true passion was in shaping the ideas – not just the mechanics – which led me to a Master's in Product Development and Innovation. Along the way, I’ve learned to understand people’s needs and translate them into real-world solutions. Outside of work, you’ll find me on the football field, capturing moments with my camera, in photo-shop or daydreaming about the next creative project. </p>
