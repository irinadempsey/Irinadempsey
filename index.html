        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>When I was little, I was completely obsessed with Lego and Meccano – they weren’t just toys, they were the gateway to my curiosity about how things are made. 

        This led me down the path of Mechanical Engineering, but after a few years, I realized that my true passion was in shaping the ideas – not just the mechanics – which led me to a Master's in Product Development and Innovation. Along the way, I’ve learned to understand people’s needs and translate them into real-world solutions. 

        Outside of work, you’ll find me on the football field, capturing moments with my camera, in Photoshop or daydreaming about the next creative project.</p>
